Title : Applying Distance Based Classifiers on Iris Dataset

Distance Classifiers: 1) Euclidean Distance
                      2) City-Block Distance
                      3) Chess-Bord Distance
                      4) Mahalanobis Distance
                      5) Correlation Distance
                      6) Cosine Distance
                      7) Bray-Curtis Distance
                      8) Canberra Distanc

Type of classes in dataset: 1) Iris-Setosa
                            2) Iris-Versicolor
                            3) Iris-Virginica

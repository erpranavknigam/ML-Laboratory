Title: Applying PCA algorithm on Facial Images

Programming Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Programming Language: Python

Packages Used: numpy
               matplotlib.image
               matplotlib.pyplot
               os
               
               

This folder contains folder "face_data" which contains 40 different folders of images of different classes and these folders contain 10-10 grayscale images of 92*112.

This folder also contains a file named "LDA on Facial Recognition.ipynb" which can be executed by jupyter notebook.

The output folder contains the output images.


Execution: After extraction of ZIP folder import the folder to workarea.
           open "PCA_Facial_Recognition.ipynb" in jupyter notebook.
           Click on "Cell".
           Click on "Run All"
           
Result: After Executiong of the LDA on Facial Recognition.ipynb file the accuracy achieved is: 77.5%. Accuracy achieved is less compared to PCA algorithm.

Title : Applying Multiple Linear Regression on Machine Dataset

Programming Environment : Jupyter Notebook

Programming Language : Python

Packages Used : 1) Numpy
                2) Pandas
                3) Matplotlib
                
This folder contains a file named "machine.csv" on which multiple linear regression is applied.

This folder contains a file named "Multiple Linear Regression.ipynb" which can be executed by using Jupyter Notebook. For Execution open the file in Jupyter Notebook and go to Cell tab, inside Cell tab click on Run All. This will execute all the available cell sequentially.

The output folder contains different plots which shows fitting lines on different X and Y values.

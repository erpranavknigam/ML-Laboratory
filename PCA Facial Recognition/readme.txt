Title: Applying PCA algorithm on Facial Images

Programming Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Programming Language: Python

Packages Used: numpy
               matplotlib.image
               matplotlib.pyplot
               os

This folder contains two folders "training_image" and "testing_image" which contains grayscale images of 128*128.

This folder also contains a file named "PCA_Facial_Recognition.ipynb" which can be executed by jupyter notebook.

The output folder contains graph of Eigen Value Mapping and output Images.


Execution: After extraction of ZIP folder import the folder to workarea.
           open "PCA_Facial_Recognition.ipynb" in jupyter notebook.
           Click on "Cell".
           Click on "Run All"

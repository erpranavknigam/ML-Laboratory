This folder contains a folder "satallite images" which contains 4 images of different bands which are used as input images.

This folder also contains a file named "PCA Satallite Images.ipynb" which can be executed by jupyter notebook.

The output folder contains graph of Eigen Value Mapping and the generated output images.


Execution: After extraction of ZIP folder import the folder to workarea.
           open "PCA Satallite Images.ipynb" in jupyter notebook.
           Click on "Cell".

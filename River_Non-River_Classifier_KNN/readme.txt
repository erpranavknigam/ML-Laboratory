Title: Applying KNN algorithm on Satallite Images

Programming Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Programming Language: Python

Packages Used: numpy
               cv2
               sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split

This folder contains 4 images of different bands which is used as input datafile.

This folder also contains a file named "River_Non-River_Classifier_KNN.ipynb" which can be executed by jupyter notebook.

The output folder contains graph of K-value vs Accuracy.


Execution: After extraction of ZIP folder import the folder to workarea.
           open "River_Non-River_Classifier_KNN.ipynb" in jupyter notebook.
           Click on "Cell".
           Click on "Run All"
